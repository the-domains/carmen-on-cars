## Michelle Rodriguez, I hate you

I DON'T KNOW if Michelle Rodriquez is furious (or even mildly annoyed), but she's fast. In fact there's a good chance she's faster than you.
Driving the new Jaguar F-Type SVR on a closed road in Nevada, the Fast and Furious actress saw 201mph on the clock.

That's 323.4km/h in our money, and it means she's gone faster than anyone I know, damnit.
Here she is looking all smug about it.

"All my corrections were minimal, I was super focused, and it really reacted in all the right ways," she says of her jaunt in the Jag.

You can [watch a vid of the whole thing here][0].

The F-Type SVR is the fastest car that Jaguar has ever built, and is the first product of the brand's high-performance Special Vehicle Operations unit.
It's got a 575 horsepower version of the F-Type R's supercharged, 5.0-litre V8, and weighs a bit less.

There's a titanium exhaust, which means it must sound ballistic.

In Singapore they're special order-only, but you can buy one if you have just over $600,000 to spend, which is our guess for what it'll cost to put it on the road.
Probably not a good idea to try and replicate Michelle's achievement yourself, though.
