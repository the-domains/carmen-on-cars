## I like the new Subaru Impreza. But I don't love it

SO, THE COVERS have come off an all-new Subaru Impreza (not in Singapore, but at the New York motor show), and they reveal a bigger car with more sculpted looks than the current one.

But what the 2017 Impreza really shows is Subaru's strategy for the next nine years, as the niche carmaker pins its hopes for growth on the new Subaru Global Platform that it will build all its cars on.

First, the Impreza shows what Subaru will retain: "boxer" (that is, horizontally-opposed) engines and its much-vaunted "symmetrical" all-wheel drive system.

There's a new design language that Subaru calls "Dynamic X Solid" which has given the new Impreza flowing but sculpted lines with taut creases. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/621b62ef-e942-45fd-b610-6124c3a41c7c.jpg)

The overall look isn't dissimilar to the "Kodo" design that has served Mazda well lately, but the Impreza hangs onto Subaru's hexagon-shaped grille and slim "hawkeye" lamps.

Hexagons (or at least, six-sided shapes) are hinted at throughout the new Impreza's cabin, too, judging from this pic:

While the new car doesn't look particularly posh inside, it's at least neat, with the button count kept low by a large touchscreen system in the middle of the dashboard.

Analogue instruments remain but there are two smaller colour screens to relay various driving info, including a centrally-mounted display, like a slimmer version of the one in the [Levorg][0].

I guess I'll reserve judgement on the Impreza until early 2017, at the next Singapore Motor Show --- that's just a guess about when it's coming here.
